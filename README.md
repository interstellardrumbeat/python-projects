# Python Projects

## Overview
This folder contains **small Python projects** created either for my job or to practice with specific libraries and modules in Python.

> Note for recruiters: These projects are designed to demonstrate practical Python usage, readable code, and clear documentation, including consistent use of NumPy-style docstrings.

Each project includes its own README with:

- Project description
- How-to-use instructions
