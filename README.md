# Python Projects

This folder contains **small Python projects** created either for my job or to practice with specific libraries and modules in Python.

> Note for recruiters: These projects showcase my ability to understand and write **clean, well-documented, and reproducible code**, as well as my skill in breaking down problems into clear, maintainable scripts — useful for roles requiring technical fluency alongside strong documentation skills.

Each project includes its own README with:

- Project description
- How-to-use instructions
- Usage examples
